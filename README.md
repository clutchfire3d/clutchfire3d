# Hi there, we are Clutchfire 👋

We are a high-end design and engineering collective dedicated to the evolution of Airsoft hardware. With a track record of creating performance kits for **AEG, HPA, and tactical accessories**, we bridge the gap between hobbyist 3D printing and professional-grade engineering.

### 🤝 Official Polarstar Partner
We work in close collaboration with **Polarstar Airsoft** technology to ensure our designs—like the Firestar—offer the best native alignment and performance on the market.

### 🛠️ Our Ecosystem
- **HPA Native Design:** Creators of the Firestar, our first major **Open Source** milestone.
- **AEG & Accessory Kits:** A wide range of internal and external upgrades for traditional platforms.
- **Precision Manufacturing:** High-quality 3D printed parts available for purchase.

### 🛍️ Shop & Social

### ❤️ Support our Open Source Projects
Creating professional-grade open-source files takes time and resources. If you love what we do, help us keep the fire burning!
