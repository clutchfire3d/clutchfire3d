# Hi there, we are Clutchfire 👋

We are a high-end design and engineering collective dedicated to the evolution of Airsoft. With a track record of performance-driven kits for **AEG, HPA, and tactical accessories**, we bridge the gap between hobbyist 3D printing and professional-grade hardware.

### 🤝 Proudly Partnered with Polarstar
We work closely with **Polarstar Airsoft** technology to ensure our designs—like the Firestar—offer the best native alignment and performance on the market.

### 🛠️ What we do:
- **Diverse Ecosystem:** From AEG internal upgrades to unique external accessories.
- **HPA Native Design:** Creators of the Firestar, the first dedicated HPA-only platform.
- **Precision Manufacturing:** High-quality printed parts available via our Instagram.

### 🔓 The Firestar Project (Open Source)
Firestar is our first major project to go **Open Source**. We believe in empowering the community with professional-level documentation and files to push the sport forward.

### ❤️ Keep the Fire Burning (Donations)
